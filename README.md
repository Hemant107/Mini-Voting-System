# Mini-Voting-System-Using-C-Language

The goal of this project is to create a secure, structured, and efficient way to conduct student elections digitally, reducing the need for manual voting and paper-based records.

      1. Start a new election (set year, branch, total voters)

      2. Add and manage candidates

      3. Load previous election data

      4. Ban invalid users

      5. Delete illegal votes

      6. View results and winner

2) Student Panel – Students can:

      1. Log in using their college ID (e.g., 2019btechs00045)

      2. Vote once for a candidate

      3. Get notified if they are ineligible or already voted

3) Security Checks:

      1. Validates student ID (year, branch, and roll number)
